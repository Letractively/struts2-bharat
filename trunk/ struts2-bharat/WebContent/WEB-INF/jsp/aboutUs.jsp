Hello So here's something that took me a long time to crack using css
only and when i finally found the solution, I couldn't believe how
simple it was!! If the title doesn't describe the technique well enough,
let me clarify it for you. When visiting a website, I always find it
really handy if the navigation reflects what page i'm currently on, i.e
if you are on the "about us" page of a site for example, isn't it cool
when the "about us" link in the navigation is highlighted or is
different to the other ones to indicate that this is where you currently
are...? Well, in theory, the a:active should do it for you, now I don't
know about you but it never worked for me... So I use to use php to
replicate the effect but I knew deep down that there was a way round it
with css, and then I found it. Now I don't know if any of you use this.
When writing semantic code, the goal is to use markup in a efficient way
thus limiting the amount a pointless tags. One thing a lot of people
don't think of is assigning an id (or class) to the

tag. Having an id on your body tag allow you some pretty cool stuff
which I won't talk about in this post as it would be beside the point.
However, adding an id to your

is the essence of this tutorial. So now... let's get coding!

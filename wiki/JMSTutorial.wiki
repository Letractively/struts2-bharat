=== Key Points ===

 # Messages are published to a topic as opposed to a queue in Point-to-Point messaging.
 # Message consumers can be 1) Durable 2) Non-Durable 3) Dynamic types.
 # Publisher does not generally know anything about subscribers.
 # Each message is delivered to multiple subscribers.
 # This is a push based model. ie Messages are pushed to subscribers (P-2-P is pull based).
 # Messages delivered to a topic are automatically pushed to all qualified subscribers.
 # As in enterprise messaging in general, there is no coupling of the producers to the consumers. Subscribers and publishers can be added dynamically at runtime, which allows the system to grow or shrink in complexity over time.
 # Every client that subscribes to a topic receives its own copy of messages published to that topic. A single message produced by one publisher may be copied and distributed to hundreds or even thousands of subscribers.

With the pub/sub model, messages published to a topic are immediately delivered to each subscriber by the JMS Provider. The subscribers do not have to scan topic for messages belonging to them. Rather the JMS provider delivers a copy of the message to each subscriber.

Subscribers can be either durable or nondurable. Nondurable subscribers receive messages
only when that subscriber is currently active and connected to the topic, whereas
durable subscribers receive all desired messages sent to that topic, regardless of whether
that subscriber is active.

== Data-Model at a glance ==

Freemarker Data-model is basically a tree. 
{{{
(root)
  |
  +- animals
  |   |
  |   +- mouse
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- size = "small"
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- price = 50
  |   |
  |   +- elephant
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- size = "large"
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- price = 5000
  |   |
  |   +- python
  |       |   
  |       +- size = "medium"
  |       |   
  |       +- price = 4999
  |
  +- test = "It is a test"
  |
  +- whatnot
      |
      +- because = "don't know" 

}}}
The variables can be treated as directories. The root, animals, elephant, python, whatnot etc.. are called *hashes*. hashes store other variables by a lookup name eg. "animals","mouse" or "price".

The variables that store a single value (size, price, test and because) are called *scalars*.

When you want to use a subvariable in a template, you specify its path from the root, and separate the steps with dots. To access the price of a mouse you write animals.mouse.price.

When you put the special ${...} codes around an expression like this, you are telling FreeMarker to output the corresponding text at that point.

There is one more important kind of variable: *sequences*. They are similar to hashes, but they don't store names for the variables they contain. Instead, they store the subvariables sequentially, and you can access them with a numerical index. For example, in this data-model, animals and whatnot.fruits are sequences:

{{{
(root)
  |
  +- animals
  |   |
  |   +- (1st)
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- name = "mouse"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- size = "small"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- price = 50
  |   |
  |   +- (2nd)
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- name = "elephant"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- size = "large"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- price = 5000
  |   |
  |   +- (3rd)
  |       |
  |       +- name = "python"
  |       |
  |       +- size = "medium"
  |       |
  |       +- price = 4999
  |
  +- whatnot
      |
      +- fruits
          |
          +- (1st) = "orange"
          |
          +- (2nd) = "banana"  
 }}}
